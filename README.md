# Data_Science
Repository for all projects and files, which are using Data Science, ML and DL technologies.

Mostly, I'm using datasets and contests from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), but there could be from other places. I will put every project into its own directory

You can use links, which are names of every project and dataset, in order to move to project and watch contents

### My solved contests and datasets in Kaggle:
1. [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](./Titanic)
2. [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](./House_prices)
